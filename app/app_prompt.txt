- Generate FreeCAD 1.0 Python code to create: 
- Requirements:
    - Must work in FreeCAD command-line mode
    - No GUI functions (FreeCADGui)
    - Ensure valid geometry creation
- DO NOT wrap the logic inside any `def` functions or `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks.
- Always include `App.newDocument(...)` to create a document.
- Always use top-level, immediately executable statements.
- Use the `Part` module to construct valid geometry.
- Recompute the document after adding objects using `doc.recompute()`.
